Preparing for the TOGAF Practitioner (Level 2) exam involves understanding not only the concepts and framework of TOGAF but also how to apply them in real-world scenarios. The exam is scenario-based, testing your ability to apply TOGAF principles and practices in practical situations.

## Exam Format and Rules
- Scenario-Based Questions: The Practitioner exam consists of complex scenario-based multiple-choice questions. These scenarios describe specific situations, challenges, or - requirements, and you must choose the best action based on TOGAF standards.
- Open Book: The TOGAF Practitioner exam is an open book test, but this only refers to a specific version of the TOGAF standard, not external materials.
- Time and Questions: The exam typically has 8 questions, and you have 90 minutes to complete it.
- Passing Score: Usually, a score of 60% or more is required to pass.
## Tips for Handling Exam Scenarios
1. **Understand the Scenario Thoroughly**: Read each scenario carefully. Pay attention to the specific requirements and challenges presented.

2. **Identify Key Elements**: Look for keywords or phrases that are directly related to TOGAF principles and practices.

3. **Apply TOGAF Principles**: Relate the scenario to TOGAFâ€™s ADM, guidelines, and techniques. Think about which part of the ADM or which specific principle or practice is most relevant to the scenario.

4. **Think Practically**: Consider how you would apply TOGAF in a real-world situation. The best answer often involves a balance between ideal theoretical application and practical constraints.

5. **Eliminate Obviously Wrong Answers**: Some options can be easily ruled out as they might clearly go against TOGAF principles.

6. **Use the Open Book Wisely**: Remember that you can refer to the TOGAF standard, so familiarize yourself with its structure and where to find key information quickly.

## Example Scenario
Scenario: Your company is planning to consolidate several legacy systems into a new, unified customer relationship management (CRM) system. As the lead architect, you are tasked with developing an architecture that supports this transformation. The company wants to ensure that the new system is scalable, cost-effective, and aligns with the overall business strategy.

A) Start by selecting a CRM system that is popular in the market.

B) Develop a Technology Architecture that supports CRM systems.
